  <h1>Creamy NY Style Cheesecake</h1>
  <div class="recipe">
    <p><strong>Tall, creamy, thick, smooth.</strong></p>
    <p>Perfect for emotional support snacking or spontaneous celebrations.</p>
  </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>6 eggs room temperature</li>
    <li>One stick unsalted butter,room temperature</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
    <li>2 cups sour cream room temperature</li>
    <li>4 8 ounce packages cream cheese room temperature</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 300°F.</li>
    <li>Generously butter the inside of a 10-inch springform pan.</li>
    <li>Cut two large pieces of foil and lay them on your work surface in a cross.</li>
    <li>Set the springform pan in the middle and fold the edges of the foil up around the sides of the pan.</li>
    <li>The foil gives you extra protection against water getting into the pan during the water bath step.</li>
    <li>In a large mixer-bowl or bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter until it is smooth and there are no lumps.</li>
    <li>Add the sour cream, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest and vanilla to the bowl and beat on medium-low speed until combined and creamy.</li>
    <li>Scrape down the beater and sides of the bowl with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Next add the eggs, one at a time, beating slowly until everything is combined.</li>
    <li>Pour into the prepared springform pan and place in a roasting pan large enough to prevent the sides from touching.</li>
    <li>Bring a few cups of water to a boil and pour the water into the roasting pan, being careful not to splash any water onto the cheesecake.</li>
    <li>Fill the pan to reach halfway up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
    <li>Bake for 2 hours, 15 minutes, or until the cake is very lightly colored and a toothpick inserted in the center emerges clean.</li>
    <li>Turn off the oven and crack the door open. Let the cheesecake cool slowly for two to three hours.</li>
    <li>Do not try to remove the cheesecake from the pan until it has set up in the refrigerator overnight or at least 6 hours.</li>
    <li>This step is crucial for letting the cheesecake set and achieving perfect cheesecake texture — don't rush it.</li>
    <li>Unmold the cake and top the cheesecake just before serving.</li>
    <li>You can either serve the cake right from the bottom of the springform pan or garnish with blackberry sauce or whatever topping you desire.</li>
  </ol>
